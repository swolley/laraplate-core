/**
 * What a granted permission actually does at this moment.
 *
 * A capability permission keeps its row whatever the per-table settings say. The row
 * is the vocabulary, and dropping it would take every grant and every ACL written on
 * that name down with it by cascade. What the settings decide is whether the
 * operation runs, and that is read at the point of use
 * ({@see \Modules\Core\Locking\Locked::usesHasLocks()} for locks,
 * {@see \Modules\Core\SoftDeletes\SoftDeletes::softDeletesEnabledBySettings()} for
 * soft deletes). The price of keeping the two apart is that somebody configuring a
 * role can grant a permission that does nothing, or something other than what it
 * says, and have no way of telling. This is what tells them.
 *
 * The map is written by hand, verb by verb, because it does not follow from the
 * capability. On this CRUD surface `delete` and `restore` are the soft-delete pair:
 * the destructive endpoint authorizes against `forceDelete`, `delete` gates the
 * inactivate operation and `restore` the activate one. So switching soft deletes off
 * silences `restore`, which has nothing left to act on, while `delete` keeps working
 * and changes meaning: {@see \Modules\Core\SoftDeletes\SoftDeletes::performDeleteOnModel()}
 * destroys the row instead of hiding it. Those are two different warnings, not one.
